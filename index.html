        <h1 class="heading">Meet the BeepLab One</h1>
        <p class="paragraph">Hey friend,</p>
        <p class="paragraph">I spent the last several months developing a seriously fun music gadget, and I’m starting
            to figure out who wants one. If you’re into this kind of thing, subscribe to the mailing list below to be
            notified when the BeepLab is released.</p>

        <h2 class="heading-2">What is it?</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">It’s a tiny portable music looper that gets you jamming immediately. It has a USB port that
            powers your MIDI controller and an audio jack that connects to your speaker or headphones.</p><img
            src="./files/PluggingIn.gif" loading="lazy" width="1000" alt="" class="image">
        <h2 class="heading-2">Why not use a computer?</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">I love making loops with a MIDI controller and a computer, but there's always a few speed
            bumps - turn on computer, log in, start up software, make new project, add new track, pick instrument - and
            then finally, play music.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Compare that to a guitar sitting on a stand - pick it up, and play. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">So for years, I dreamed of that immediate feeling with my MIDI controller. But I didn’t
            want another small piano - I wanted something cheap, that loops, and works with my own MIDI controller.
        </p>
        <h2 class="heading-2">How does it work?</h2>
        <p class="listhead">It ships with software that gives you:</p>
        <ul role="list" class="list">
            <li class="list-item">Four instrument tracks with individual volume control.<br></li>
            <li class="list-item">A metronome to toggle a click track.<br></li>
            <li class="list-item">A tempo knob that stretches and shrinks recorded notes.<br></li>
        </ul><img src="./files/HowTo.gif" loading="lazy" width="1000" alt="" class="image">
        <h2 class="heading-2">What else can it do?</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">At its core, the BeepLab is an Arduino Uno, and the software will be provided open source.
            I want to give you an easy and fun way to learn electronics programming, without needing to solder anything
            yourself.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">The BeepLab can jam with more than just a MIDI controller. It has a USB port, and
            a Qwiic port. <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic" class="link">Qwiic</a> is a system of connectors
            that make it easy to add sensors to your project without soldering. </p>
        <p class="listhead">Some ideas:</p>
        <ul role="list" class="list">
            <li class="list-item">Make music with a mouse, a keyboard, or a video game controller.</li>
            <li class="list-item">Use a <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16476" class="link">pressure
                    sensor</a> and a 3D-printed mouthpiece to make a trumpet.</li>
            <li class="list-item">Use a <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15219" class="link">pulse sensor</a>
                to set the track’s tempo to your heart rate.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="paragraph">You can also change the default instruments: the synth chip has 128 different
            instruments that you can use.</p><img src="./files/LearningExtras.gif" loading="lazy" width="1000" alt=""
            class="image">
        <h2 class="heading-2">What can't it do?</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">There are some things the BeepLab cannot do. You can only store 100 notes in recording. You
            can only pick from the 128 onboard instruments, no samples. And you can only listen to loops as you play
            them, no saving loops.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">But it’s just... A. Ton. Of. Fun. I'd argue the simplicity makes it <em>more</em> fun,
            because it’s just so darn easy to pick up and start playing. In practice, 100 notes is quite enough to lay
            out some face-scrunchy uhh-huh funk to jam along with.</p>
        <h2 class="heading-2">OK, I want one!</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">Awesome! I've done a lot of work to make the BeepLab robust and ready for manufacturing.
            Below is the final version for release. I'll probably run a Kickstarter campaign when I gather enough
            interest.<br>

        <h2 class="heading-2">What's next?</h2>
        <p class="paragraph"><strong></strong>I was in engineering school as the Arduino really started taking off, and
            I feel a debt of gratitude to the ecosystem it created. I think of this as my humble homage.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><strong></strong>I'd love to see this grow into a line of instruments and tools for music
            producers, musicians, engineers, and students alike. It's a fun music gadget by itself, and music is a fun
            way to get hooked on programming.</p>
        <h2 class="heading-2">Thank you!</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">Huge huge huge thanks to all the people who have offered their feedback and support: Chris
            Quintero, Michael Brust, Mick Tinker, Spencer Wright, Russ Waddell, James Marks, Russ Fogle, Nick Parker,
            Shawn Kirsch, Joshua Schachter, Nick Chelyapov, Serena May, Dieter Brommer, Marcelo Coelho, Kevin Greene,
            and Andrew Edman.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">I'd also like to thank <a href="https://chome.nerpa.tech/about/" class="link">Oleg at
                Circuits@Home</a> and <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/about" class="link">Limor Fried / Ladyada at
                Adafruit</a>. Oleg built the <a
                href="https://chome.nerpa.tech/mcu/usb-host-shield-library-version-2-0-released/" class="link">USB Host
                Shield project</a> which makes reading from USB possible. Ladyada wrote <a
                href="https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_VS1053_Library" class="link">the library</a> that gets the
            MIDI synth chip running. Without these projects, this one would have taken much, much longer.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">And big thanks to <em>you</em> for your interest. I hope you enjoy!</p>
